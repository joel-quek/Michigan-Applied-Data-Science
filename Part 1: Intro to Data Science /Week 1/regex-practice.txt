Answer for Question 5
What is the correct regular expression to match a URL with letters, numbers, underscores and dots? A valid URL defined in this problem must meet the following requirements:

The URL consists of two or more strings made of letters, numbers, and underscores.
A dot is used in between the strings.
No two dots are allowed to appear consecutively.
For example, your regex should match URLs like: www.aBC.com, abc.com, ab_c.de8f.com
But your regex should not match: abc, abc..com

One possible solution:
(\w+\.)+\w+


Answer for Question 6
What is the correct regular expression to match an ISBN number from two publishers (World Scientific from Singapore, and Sigma Publications from Greece)? A valid ISBN code defined in this problem must meet the following requirements:

The ISBN number consists of 10 digits, with dashes(-) in between.
The ISBN number must match the patterns of one of the following publishers(x means a digit from 0 to 9): for World Scientific, the pattern should be xxxx-x-xxxx-x, and for Sigma Publications, the pattern should be xxx-xxx-xxx-x.
For example, your regex should match ISBNs like: 9971-5-0210-0, 960-425-059-0

One possible solution:
\d{4}-\d-\d{4}-\d|\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}-\d


Answer for Question 7
What is the correct regular expression to match a DOI registered by Crossref? A valid DOI(e.g. doi:10.1038/nphys1170) defined in this problem must meet the following requirements:

The DOI starts with doi:
The link has two parts divided by a “/”. In the first part, there can only be numbers and dots, and in the second part, there can be any characters. There should be at least one character in each part.
For example, your regex should match DOIs like: doi:10.1038/nphys1170, doi:10.1002/0470841559.ch1

One possible solution:
doi:[\d.]+/.+
